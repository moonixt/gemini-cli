feat: Address PR feedback and fix planning tool loop

This commit addresses feedback from the PR review and fixes a bug in the planning tool.

Changes:
- Uses the `DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL` constant in `planning-tool.ts` instead of a hardcoded string.
- Ensures the `planning_tool` respects the `excludeTools` configuration in `config.ts`.
- Improves the readability of tool execution logs in `subagent.ts` by formatting and truncating tool arguments.
- Fixes an infinite loop in the subagent execution by checking for goal completion immediately after processing tool calls.
- Updates tests in `subagent.test.ts` to reflect the corrected loop behavior.
